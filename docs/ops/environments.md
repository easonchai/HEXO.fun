# Environments

Three environments, each with its own program keypair under `keys/` (gitignored), chosen by a
cargo feature at build time (ADR 0013). `declare_id!` in `programs/hex_vault/src/lib.rs` picks
the ID; `Anchor.toml` only lists dev (`[programs.localnet]`, `[programs.devnet]`) and mainnet
(`[programs.mainnet]`), since staging is not an Anchor cluster and `scripts/deploy.sh` passes its
keypair explicitly.

| | dev | staging | mainnet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program ID | `LFk9ba6QXuM9oYRRNGGPxMGzfo13X3DAr8ghSPz72C6` | `H2iWyng2orJpHNGGWhrR7rBQNDqixThpTpAwF4dnPXax` | `EwqRKGqnH7dGwL5ERMGQc2tsLKwT3duzKWPcCDphyPCH` |
| Cluster | devnet (laptop and VPS) | devnet | mainnet-beta |
| Compose file | `docker-compose.dev.yml` (laptop) / `docker-compose.yml` (VPS) | `docker-compose.staging.yml` (`include:`s `docker-compose.yml`) | `docker-compose.yml` |
| Env file | `.env` | `.env.staging` | `.env.mainnet` |
| Backend host | laptop: `127.0.0.1:8080`; VPS: `api-hexo.elvtd.io` | `API_HOST` in `.env.staging`: _fill in_ | `API_HOST` in `.env.mainnet`: _fill in_ |
| Vercel scope | Existing `hexofun-beta.vercel.app` project (predates this split): _fill in whether it moves to the `dev`-branch Preview below_ | Preview, scoped to the `dev` branch (`apps/web/.env.staging.example`) | Production, scoped to `main`: `app.hexofun.lol` (landing at `hexofun.lol`) |
| Live pool IDs | Several ad hoc pools exist today (`.env`, `.env.dev`, `.env.vps`, `.env.vps1`); ticket 15 retires `.env.vps` and `.env.vps1` once staging is up. _Fill in the pool this environment settles on._ | Not bootstrapped yet (ticket 15 is pending); `.env.staging.example`'s `POOL_ID=1` is a placeholder | Not deployed yet; `.env.mainnet.example`'s `POOL_ID=1` is a placeholder |

Devnet RPC keys, mainnet RPC keys, and every real secret live only in the gitignored `.env*`
files, never in `.env*.example` or in this doc.

## Adding a pool without touching old ones

A pool's PDA seed is `["pool", pool_id]` alone, global across the whole program rather than
scoped to any authority, so a new pool never collides with an existing one on the same program.
Adding a pool means:

1. Pick an unused `POOL_ID`.
2. `pnpm --filter @hexvault/backend bootstrap` against that ID (creates `Pool`, its vaults, and
   the House `Player`; reuses an existing mint if you pass one).
3. Point a backend stack's env file at the new `POOL_ID` (and, if it is a fresh mint, the new
   `ACCEPTED_MINT`), then recreate that stack. Keep the database volume: every pool-scoped row
   carries its pool's address, so the retired pool's rows stay as history and Invite codes,
   Referral codes and Referrals carry over ([ADR 0016](../adr/0016-database-outlives-the-pool.md)).
   `docker compose down -v` is a local-only way to get an empty database; it deletes every
   invite and referral.
4. Point the matching frontend build's `VITE_POOL_ID` at it and redeploy.

Every other pool on that program is untouched: bootstrap only writes new accounts. Since
`Pool`, `Epoch` and `Player` now carry `version` and reserved padding (ADR 0013), a field added
in a later upgrade no longer forces a fresh pool the way it used to; a fresh pool is for a new
deployment (dev/demo reset, a new environment) or for a change that genuinely cannot be
append-only (see below), not for routine growth.

## When a new program ID is warranted

Per-environment program IDs (this doc's table) exist so a devnet upgrade cannot break staging or
mainnet, and so mainnet never reuses a keypair that ever ran on devnet. Within one environment, a
new program ID (and therefore a fresh set of pools) is warranted only when an upgrade cannot be
made append-only:

- An existing field is removed, reordered or resized, rather than a new one appended.
- An account's meaning changes incompatibly (not just a new interpretation of a zero value with a
  `version` bump).

An additive field taken from `_reserved`, a new instruction, a new event or error variant, or an
admin parameter change never needs a new program ID; that is the point of ADR 0013's upgrade
policy. See [`docs/ops/deploy.md`](deploy.md#upgrade-policy-adr-0013).

A new program ID does not carry the database over yet. The boot guard refuses any Pool row
whose address does not derive from its `poolId` under the configured `PROGRAM_ID`, which is how
it catches a wrong `DATABASE_URL`, and a pool from the old program looks exactly like that. A
fresh pool on the same program ID is the path ADR 0016 covers.
