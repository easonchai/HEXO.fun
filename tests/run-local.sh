# hex_vault.so for test-vrf symbols) must still pass against whatever was
# there before. target/idl and target/types are backed up and restored
# wholesale: `anchor build` fully regenerates both every time, features or
# not. target/deploy keeps its program keypair(s) untouched instead of
# moving the directory away: the keypair's address is what every existing
# Pool and every client default (DEFAULT_PROGRAM_ID) already assumes, and
# `anchor build` only *generates* one when the file is missing, so leaving
# it in place is what keeps a repeat local run deploying at the same id. Only
# the built artifact (hex_vault.so) is swapped out and restored.
