/**
 * Ticket 07 / spec.md "One end-to-end test asserts the network boundary":
 * the regression test for ticket 01's key exposure and for "the Indexer is
 * the browser's read model" more broadly. No wallet, no backend needed for
 * this to be meaningful: with nothing connected, the browser has zero
 * legitimate reason to contact any Solana RPC host at all, since the sole
 * surviving direct chain read (the connected wallet's own token balance)
 * never fires without a connected wallet (see src/read.ts `useWalletBalance`).
 * A regression that reintroduces a chain read into a component — the exact
 * failure mode this ticket removes — shows up here as a request to one of
 * the hosts below, whether or not it is the one the app is configured for.
 *
 * Checked against known RPC provider domains rather than one specific
 * configured host, so this holds regardless of which endpoint `.env`/
 * `.env.local` points at, and against both a local dev server and a
 * deployed URL (E2E_BASE_URL) per playwright.config.ts.
 *
 * What this does NOT cover: that a *connected* wallet's balance read lands
 * on the public endpoint specifically, rather than some other RPC host —
 * that needs a signed-in wallet, which needs a local validator (see
 * demo.spec.ts), unavailable in this run.
